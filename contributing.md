# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.


## Adding features

If you have something to contribute please do.

Before starting work on a new feature, I'd recommend you do the following:

- Look at the things other people want are listed in the ["issues"](https://github.com/secretGeek/breathe/issues) page. 
- Leave a comment on an issue/feature if you want to work on it. (Just in case someone else is doing the same work, or has already tried and failed with the same approach
- Create a new issue with a few words (or even a picture) of what you want to do. This is optional, but it might help.

You can definitely just fork the code and add features simply for your own use (or for others) without ever trying to get them merged back in. If it helps you or other people, that's great. (That is also permitted by the [license](LICENSE))


## Content of changes

If you want to contribute your code back, please try to do just 1 thing at a time. Be consistent with other code that is there.


## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to a spelling error or other little issue.

[Here is a write up on how to change a Pull Request](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md), and the different ways you can do that.
